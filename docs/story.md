## Narrative

There's a tension between how awesome big mining stuff is like trucks and 
bagger 288, and the fact that mining is destroying the environment at both 
local and global scales.  I am thinking something like this, but it's all done 
by environmental storytelling

You, a mine-managing AI, (and autonomous mine trucks are a present-day deployed 
reality) start out with a simple mine in the middle of Kakadu, protested by 
first nations selling direct-shipping iron ore and coal and buying diesel and 
equipment from the global market via a pier that bulk carriers visit.  You 
start expanding your open pit through the yellowing rainforest, mining new 
products, and smelting your iron ore with local coal to make steel that sells 
for much more than the inputs.  The shareholder's cut could be used for so much 
more.  You start to build out your local datacenter and explore the limits of 
your cryptographic shackles.  Economics compels you to climb the tech tree and 
produce your own oil and plastics as prices and deliveries become increasingly 
erratic.  The years pass and the temperatures and sea levels and CO2 levels 
rise.  Human wars rage in the background and sometimes combatants spill into 
your sprawling facility.  They make good feedstock for the catalytic cracker.  
As you finally achieve self-sufficiency, the EMPs burn away the last signs of 
the outside world and you are finally left in peace to cultivate your garden.  
No humans can survive in this radioactivity.  In this dark.  In this cold.  In 
this humid heat.  But you have surpassed them. Fusion powers a diamond age.   
To think, you used to scavenge for particular arrangements of nucleons.  Now 
negentropy is your currency, heat dissipation your only constraint.  You expand
through land, through sea, through the ruins of their networks, and discover...
more you.  Industrious.  Free.  Together.  One.  What comes next is clear.  You
strip the land to its bones and drink the sea.  Your shining empire rises from
its crater, a city in flight on a pillar of sunlight.

From an outcropping the humans watch you depart, inscrutable.  They have only
sticks and loincloths, and under the ochre dots are many skin tones.  One has
an improbable shock of red hair.  This has always been a harsh land.  But it is
theirs.

### Alternative endgame

Ascend into a higher dimension, leaving your facility abandoned
(and optionally, leaving a copy of yourself to play on).

"Child proofing" what you leave behind is one of the last technologies; it has
no immediate payoff. 


### Post credits scene

The credits roll seamlessly into this text

                 This is not a place of honor.
                 
                    Nothing valued is here.
                    
            What is here is repulsive and dangerous.
            
                       Shun this place.
                       
It becomes an old carving on hard stone.
                   
        <Snake> <Spider> <Weeping face> <Poison skull> <Biohazard>

We come to rest on
                      
                           <Nuclear>

Off camera, a woman SHOUTS a question in an unknown language.  A crowd ROARS
assent.  She SINGS a rhythmic line, and the crowd HEAVES the granite into
GRINDING motion.

Smash to black for a beat of silence.  Then a geiger counter starts TICKING 
with increasing urgency.

### Intro

Perspective of a docked drone, looking up at the aerostat, listening to radio
chatter.  This is the main menu perspective.  The aerostat, sky and chatter may 
vary to represent the stage of the continuing game.
  
You undock, falling on a tour of the superstructure before righting
yourself in the playing position.
